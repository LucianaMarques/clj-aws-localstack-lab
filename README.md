# clj-aws-localstack-lab

Some examples using [LocalStack](https://github.com/localstack/localstack) with clojure.

## Usage

I used Docker in order to run LocalStack environment. You need Docker and `docker-compose` installed (instructions [here](https://github.com/localstack/localstack#running-in-docker)) 

The `docker-compose.yml` file I used is in the `local-stack` folder, with a few configurations for my tests. For other configurations and options, see the [LocalStack docs](https://github.com/localstack/localstack#running-in-docker)
